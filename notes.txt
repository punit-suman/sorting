Best by time: Merge Sort - O(nlogn)
Best by space: All, except Merge Sort

Merge Sort vs Quick Sort
- same average time
- merge sort has better worst case time
- merge sort takes O(n) extra space

Selection sort vs Bubble sort
- one or more swaps in selection sort, consecutive swapping in bubble sort iteratively

Insertion sort vs Bubble sort
- insertion - picking and transferring the next element at right position in the partially sorted array without disturbing sequence of other elements (one element at a time)
- bubble - going through the whole array iteratively and swapping consecutive terms if not in order
